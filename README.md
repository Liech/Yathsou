Recreating the Supreme Commander 1 Engine.

Using the same Assets.

It is not the goal to be precise, but modern.

# Showcase

Eye Of Rhianne is an interactive asset explorer for supreme commander 1. It is a byproduct on the journey to the full rts game.

# Current Work

The current working topic is unit movement.

Since the last 'release' the following was implemented:
 
 * Basic Wheeled Unit Movement (only direct steering)
 * Unit Selection & Rectangle Selection
 * Added Dear IMGUI for greater debugging capabilities
 * SCD Archives can be used directly (no more unpack everything into the EyeOfRihanne Data Folder)
 * Basic Unit Single & Rectangle Selection
 * Basic Unit Move Command Barebone
 * HeightMap Physics
 * Map Renderer with textures
 * Sound loading / playing (XACT xwb/xsb). Although sound names are mixed up

# Contribute

It would be great if you are willing to help. Hit me up on Discord.

I am able to communicate in English and German.

# Build and Run

Use Visual Studio 2019 (or above) and Windows.

Planning to move to cmake at some point. After that Linux is theoretical also possible.
