Using the same Assets.

It is not the goal to be precise, but modern.

This is only a collection of libraries. Take a look at [Eye of Rhianne](https://github.com/Liech/EyeOfRhianne) for an executeable.

# Contribute

It would be great if you are willing to help. Hit me up on Discord.

I am able to communicate in English and German.

# Build and Run

This library collection has no executeable. Take a look at my other projects.

 * You need git, cmake and Visual Studio (Any other IDE is fine, but may require other steps)
 * After checking out this project make sure all submodules are up to date.
 * Then execute the 0,1 and 2 .bat files to set up vcpkg.
 * If you are using Linux: Good Luck, it could work but is not tested.
 * If you are used to cmake: Make sure to set the vcpkg toolchain file
 * If not read the 3 file or ask me personally
